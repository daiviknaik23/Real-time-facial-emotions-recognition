# Real-Time Emotion Detection using CNN 😐😊😠

# Overview

This project is a Real-Time Emotion Detection System that uses Deep Learning and Computer Vision to classify human emotions from facial expressions. The system is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the fer2013 dataset and can recognize 7 emotions:

Angry

Disgust

Fear

Happy

Neutral

Sad

Surprise

The trained model is then used in a real-time application to detect emotions via a webcam.

# Features

✅ Trains a deep learning model using CNN to classify emotions.

✅ Uses OpenCV for real-time face detection.

✅ Loads a pre-trained model to predict emotions on live video streams.

✅ Displays detected faces and their predicted emotions in real-time.

# Technologies Used

- Python 🐍

- OpenCV (for real-time face detection)

- TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning model)

- NumPy, Pandas (for data handling)

- Matplotlib (for visualization)
